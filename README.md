# Video-Player
A video player built entirely from Java and JavaFX which when a folder is chosen plays all the videos in the folder and the ones in sub-folders inside that chosen folder in alphabetical order or in numerical order. I built this player as at the time I couldn't find a player with that functionality and the main purpose I built this for was to watch the downloaded tutorials which are arranged in folders and can also be used to watch tv-series which are arranged  in folders by seasons under a main folder.
