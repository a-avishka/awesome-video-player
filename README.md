# Video-Player
A video player built from Java and JavaFX which when a folder is chosen plays all the videos in the folder and the ones in sub-folders inside that chosen folder in alphabetical order or in numerical order and this player can also hibernate during a video so you can continue where you left-off later.

## Whats special about this player
1. Allows you to play all videos even the ones in sub-folder in a main folder in order.
2. Allows you to hibernate and start from where you left earlier.

## How to install 
Extract the compressed (.7z) archive and move the extracted folder to C:\Program Files. Then go inside the folder and set .exe application to always run as admin, you can do this right-clicking on the .exe file -- Properties -- Compatibility -- Then check the Run as an administrator checkbox. Now you are good to go. To make things further easier create a shortcut of the .exe file and paste it somewhere its easy for you.

## How to use it

First click on the Menu icon (hamburger icon) on bottom left and choose the folder containing video that you need to play.
Other icons are the usual stuff , just place your cursor over any to see the function.
The two arrow icons allows to jump between videos in the folder.
The last 2 icons are special ones, press the last button (on left to volume slider) to hibernate and before last to continue last watched video(lets say you are watching your favorite tv-series, you have now finished watching some videos and you got to suddenly leave, then press the hibernate button (a.k.a Save & Exit button) to save your current position so when you get some time later to continue your tv-series you can open the player and click on the continue button next to the hibernate button to continue from where you left.)
